# DECLARE statement

. `DECLARE` statement is used to specift an attribute of the variables

### Examples

```PL/1
DECLARE NAME CHAR(20);
NAME = 'mainframe tutorials'
```
We are declaring a variable called `NAME` of `CHAR(20)`. We can then initialize it with the value moved from the right hand side of the operand.

Unused positions of the variable name are padded on the right with blanks. For example, we are declaring a `NAME` attribute of type `CHAR(20)` that means we set the value of `NAME` of 20 character, if you don't set it of 20 character, the rest will be set with `\0` character.
