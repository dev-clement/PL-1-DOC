# LIST DIRECTED INPUT-OUTPUT

## GET LIST

The `GET LIST` procedure is used to accept input, each input value must be separated from each other by a blank or even a comma,

### Example of use

`GET LIST(X, Y, Z)` this example state that we fetch three attributes from the user, the procedure named `GET LIST` is called and will fill the variable `X`, `Y` and `Z` with the value coming from the user.

Something to note is that you can call the `GET LIST` in different way for instance:

```PL1
GET LIST(X, Y, Z);
```

Or:

```PL1
GET LIST(X Y Z)
```

Each call will retrieve value from the input and fill each variable passed as argument to the `GET LIST` procedure.

## PUT LIST

The procedure named `PUT LIST` is used to put a list of element (variables) in a specific stream, this stream can be either a file, a standard output and so on.

This statement can be used to display element in the standard output in order to see the values.

### Example:

```PL1
DEFINES A = 1;
DEFINES B = 25;
DEFINES C = 49;
DEFINES D = 73
PUT LIST(A B C D);
```

In the example above, we are defining 3 variables named `Ã€`, `B`, `C` and `D`. These values can be moved to the stream (output standard) and display those values to the user.

Constants, variables or expressions can be specified as data items.

```PL1
DEFINES A = 1;
DEFINES B = 25;
DEFINES C = 49;
DEFINES D = 73
PUT LIST(A, B, 7, A * B);
```

In the above example, we can see that the `PUT LIST` procedure can take either variables `A` and `B` are variables, constant value `7` and even expression `A * B`.

### Important Commands using `PUT LIST`

#### Skip one line before printing to a stream

```PL1
PUT SKIP;
PUT LIST(123);
```
This statement is used in order to skip a line onto the output stream in order to `PUT` a list with one element `123`.

#### Skip N lines before printing

```PL1
PUT SKIP(N);
PUT LIST(123);
```
This `PUT SKIP(N)` will jump onto the stream before doing anything below this statement, in the above example, we can see that this statement will jump N blank lines before displaying the `123`.

#### Start a new page

```PL1
PUT PAGE LIST('PRINT-NEXT PAGE');
```
This procedure `PUT PAGE` is used to create a new page, and by using the `LIST` procedure after that it will create a new page with the content `PRINT-NEXT PAGE`.
