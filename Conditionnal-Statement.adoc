# Conditional statement

## If statement
The if statement is used when a test or decision is to be made in the program. This if statement is using conditionnal operators like the followings:
```PL/1
GE or >=
```
The above example is a condition that can be used on an `if` statement, when you are verifying if LHS is greater or equal to the RHS.
```PL/1
GT or >
```
The above example is a condition that can be used on an `if` statement, when you are checking wether or not your LHS is greater than the RHS
```PL/1
LT or <
```
The above example is a condition that can be used on an `if` statement, when you are checking that whether or not your LHS is lesser than RHS
```PL/1
LE or <=
```
The above example is a condition that can be used on an `if` statement, when you are checking that whether or not you `LHS` is lesser than or equal to the `RHS`.

### Example
. Simple IF
```PL/1
IF A = B THEN PUT LIST('A = B');
```
. Compound IF
```PL/1
IF A = B THEN
    X = 1;
ELSE
    X = 2;
```
