# Assignments statements

`SUM = 30` This assignment will contains 2 attribute, one at the left of the `=` named LHS and one at the right of the `=` named RHS.

The value of the expression RHS is moved to the variable LHS of the symbol `=`.

### Example of PL/1 addition

```PL1
SUM = X + Y + Z;
COUNT = COUNT + 1;
```

PL/1 statements may contains blanks as needed to improve the readability of the program. Statement can also be continued across several lines. And one line can contain several PL/1 statements.

### Example of several statements inline.

```PL1
GET LIST(X Y Z); SUM = X + Y + Z;
```
In the above example, we can see that there is two statements (one statement is ending with a `;`) we can add as many as statements as there is in one line until the end of the content.
